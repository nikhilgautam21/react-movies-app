## Description
It is a structure that I follow for reactjs apps. It has following features:
- Essential packages: react-router-dom, react-redux, redux, redux-saga ,jest, react-testing-library
- Easy to manager folder structure separating components, reducers and pages.
- Configured scripts to test and run server

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run test:watch`

Launches jest test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
